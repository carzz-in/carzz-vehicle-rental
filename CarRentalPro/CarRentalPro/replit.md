## Overview

This is a full-stack vehicle rental application built with React and Express. The app provides a mobile-first interface for browsing, booking, and managing both car and bike rentals. It features a modern design using shadcn/ui components and implements a PostgreSQL database through Drizzle ORM.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Storage**: DatabaseStorage class using PostgreSQL (migrated from in-memory)

### Mobile-First Design
- Responsive layout optimized for mobile devices
- Bottom navigation pattern for mobile UX
- Maximum width container (max-w-md) for phone-like experience
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management (username, email, personal details)
- **Cars**: Vehicle inventory with pricing, location, and availability
- **Bikes**: Two-wheeler inventory with pricing, location, and availability
- **Bookings**: Rental transactions linking users to vehicles with time periods

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/cars` - List all available cars
- `GET /api/cars/:id` - Get specific car details
- `GET /api/cars/search` - Search cars by query or location
- `GET /api/bikes` - List all available bikes
- `GET /api/bikes/:id` - Get specific bike details
- `GET /api/bookings` - Get user bookings
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking
- `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/status` - Update booking status

### UI Pages
- **Cars**: Car browsing with search and filtering
- **Bikes**: Bike browsing with search and filtering
- **Bookings**: User's rental history and active bookings
- **Profile**: User account management
- **Car Details Modal**: Detailed car information and booking
- **Booking Modal**: Rental booking form with date/time selection

## Data Flow

1. **Car Discovery**: Users browse cars on the home page with real-time availability
2. **Search & Filter**: Query cars by make/model or filter by category (economy, premium, electric)
3. **Booking Process**: Select car → view details → choose dates → confirm booking
4. **Booking Management**: View active/completed bookings with status updates
5. **Real-time Updates**: TanStack Query provides automatic data synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **zod**: Schema validation
- **wouter**: Lightweight routing
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### Development Tools
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Production bundling for server
- **vite**: Frontend development and building

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Configuration
- **Modules**: Node.js 20, Web, PostgreSQL 16
- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Production Build**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles server
- **Deployment**: Autoscale deployment target with port 5000→80 mapping

### Environment Setup
- Database URL required for PostgreSQL connection
- Development uses Vite dev server with HMR
- Production serves static files from Express

### Database Management
